# Smart Home X 🚀

## Overview 🏡

This project is a **Smart Home IoT application** integrated with **Google Assistant**, enabling control of lights via voice commands while also displaying real-time **temperature and humidity** of the room. It is developed using a **Raspberry Pi** with a customized dashboard, integrating various sensors, including a **DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor** and a **light sensor**, to monitor environmental conditions and enable automation.

## Features ✨

- **🌡️ Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Collects temperature and humidity data using the **DHT11 sensor**.
- **💡 Light Intensity Detection**: Tracks ambient light levels with a **light sensor**.
- **🏠 Home Automation**: Enables automation based on sensor data.
- **📊 Real-time Data Visualization**: Displays live sensor readings on a **customized dashboard**.
- **🗣️ Voice Control with Google Assistant**: Allows users to **turn lights on and off** using voice commands.
