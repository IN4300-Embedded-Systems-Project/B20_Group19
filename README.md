# Smart Home X 
### Overview

This project is a Smart Home IoT application integrated with Google Assistant, enabling contol of lights over voice commands, that also displays the realtime temperature and humidity of the room. This is developed utilizing a Raspberry Pi with a customized dashboard, integrating various sensors, including a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and a light sensor, to monitor environmental conditions and enable automation.

### Features

Temperature and Humidity Monitoring: The DHT11 sensor is used to collect temperature and humidity data.

Light Intensity Detection: Tracks ambient light levels using a light sensor.

Home Automation: Enables automation based on sensor data.

Real-time Data Visualization: View live sensor readings through the customized dashboard.

Voice Control with Google Assistant: Allows users to turn lights on and off using voice commands via Google Assistant.
